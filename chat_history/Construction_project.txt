**Construction Project Resources:**

1. **Budget:** The budget for a construction project can vary widely depending on the scope, size, and complexity of the project. A rough estimate for a small to medium-sized construction project could be around $500,000 to $2 million. However, this amount can increase significantly for larger projects.
2. **Tools:**
	* Heavy machinery (e.g., cranes, excavators, bulldozers)
	* Power tools (e.g., drills, saws, sanders)
	* Hand tools (e.g., hammers, tape measures, level tools)
	* Safety equipment (e.g., hard hats, safety glasses, steel-toed boots)
3. **Storage:**
	* On-site storage containers for materials and equipment
	* Warehouse or storage facility for larger equipment and supplies
	* Secure storage for valuable materials and tools

**Required Skills for Construction Project:**

1. **Project Management:** Experience in managing construction projects, including scheduling, budgeting, and supervising.
2. **Architecture and Design:** Knowledge of building design, architecture, and engineering principles.
3. **Construction Engineering:** Experience with construction methods, materials, and techniques.
4. **Contract Management:** Ability to manage contracts, negotiate with suppliers, and ensure compliance with regulations.
5. **Safety Management:** Knowledge of safety protocols and regulations to ensure a safe working environment.

**Available Employees and Their Skills:**

6. Sahil Repuriya (Web development)
7. Prerna Kulkarni (Building AI Agent)

**Recommended Employee Assignments:**

1. **Project Management:** Vivek Choudhary can oversee the project management aspects, but may need additional support from experienced construction professionals.
2. **Data Analysis:** Raj Ambavane, Ishika Dubey, and G Kirtika can work together to analyze data related to the construction project, such as material usage, labor costs, and schedule optimization.
3. **AI and ML Applications:** Yugal Singh, Prerna Kulkarni, and G Kirtika can explore potential applications of AI and ML in the construction project, such as predictive maintenance, quality control, or supply chain optimization.

**Skills Gap:**

Unfortunately, none of the available employees have direct experience in construction, architecture, or engineering. To ensure the success of the construction project, it is highly recommended to hire employees with the necessary skills, including:

1. **Construction Project Manager:** Experienced in managing construction projects, including scheduling, budgeting, and supervising.
2. **Architect or Engineer:** Knowledgeable in building design, architecture, and engineering principles.
3. **Construction Superintendent:** Experienced in overseeing construction operations, including site management and labor supervision.
4. **Safety Specialist:** Knowledgeable in safety protocols and regulations to ensure a safe working environment.

These hires will provide the necessary expertise to complement the available employees and ensure the successful completion of the construction project.
